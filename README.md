# 👋 Hi, I'm Catarina

🎓 I’m a 26-year-old student seeking my first professional opportunity in the data field.  

I was born in Madeira and moved to Lisbon to study. I don’t plan to return to the island anytime soon, as I have a strong desire to grow and challenge myself in new environments. I want to live in different countries, immerse myself in diverse cultures, and expand my horizons both personally and professionally. Experiencing different ways of life and learning from new perspectives is something I see as essential for my growth and for building a versatile, adaptable mindset.  

I’ve been curious since I was a child — my grandmother still tells me to stop asking “why,” but I think it’s part of who I am. I enjoy understanding the logic behind things that already have an explanation, and trying to find explanations for those that don’t.  

This curiosity drives me to constantly learn new things and explore hobbies — from painting, mixology, DIY projects, and gardening, to discovering other creative pursuits along the way.
